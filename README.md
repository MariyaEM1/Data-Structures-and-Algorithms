# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of practice exercises on Data Structures and Algorithms that I have worked on. The exercises cover a range of topics including sorting algorithms, data structures such as trees, graphs and more. These exercises have been completed as part of my personal study and practice in the field of computer science."
